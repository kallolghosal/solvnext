                        <p>Our education portfolio is diverse, covering the right to education, education for livelihoods, education governance, ICT (Information, Communication, Technology) and innovations in education. We have worked across the entire cycle of learning, from early child-care, school education, supplementary and vocational training, life-skills education and workplace advancement.</p>
                        <p>We have conducted impact evaluations to provide evidence for decision-making on scale and for investment in education initiatives such as the Prajayatna and Nali Kali government projects in Karnataka, and Pratham-Vodafoneâ€™s ICT initiatives in urban and rural sites across their programme locations in India.</p>
                        <p>We anchored and supported the implementation of the Centre for Education (CEI) and Results for Development (R4D) in India. We have also evaluated several early childhood programmes. Through projects for Agastya and Pratham Books, we have assessed the curiosity of students for science and their association with story books.</p>
